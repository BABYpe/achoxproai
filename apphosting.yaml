# Environment variables are secrets that should be stored in a secret manager.
# You can create a secret in Google Cloud Secret Manager, and grant App Hosting's
# service account access to it.
#
# For this project, a GEMINI_API_KEY is required to use Google's Generative
# AI services.
#
# You can create a secret by running the following command in your terminal:
#
#   echo -n "YOUR_API_KEY" | gcloud secrets create gemini-api-key --data-file=-
#
# and grant the App Hosting service account access to it:
#
#   gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding gemini-api-key \
#     --member="serviceAccount:service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-apphosting.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
#     --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
#
# Then, uncomment the following lines:
#
# env:
#   - variable: GEMINI_API_KEY
#     secret: gemini-api-key

# For prototyping, you can set the key directly here.
# IMPORTANT: Do not check API keys into source control in a real project.
